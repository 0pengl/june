Installation
=============

June is still under heavy development.


virtualenv
----------

Virtualenv is probably what you want to use during development,
and if you have shell access to your production machines,
youâ€™ll probably want to use it there, too.

It is strongly suggested that you develop on virtualenv.

If you are on Linux or Mac OS X, you can install it with::

    $ sudo pip install virtualenv

if you have no pip::

    $ sudo easy_install virtualenv

And you should use **pip** instead of easy_install, install pip with::

    $ sudo easy_install pip

If you are on Windows, you should try **MinGW** or **Cygwin** .

Read document of virtualenv for a better life. But you can start now with::

    $ mkdir ~/env
    $ virtualenv ~/env/june

When the installation is finished, active this virtual environment::

    $ source ~/env/june/bin/active

Now, you are on a virtual environment called june. Any python package will be installed
on this june environment now::

    $ python setup.py install
